# Five_in_a_row
The game is played on a hexagonal board instead of a square board. Two players alternately put their “stones” at any empty position of the board. The black player puts first. A player wins once he forms a chain of exactly five stones along the lines of the board. If no ones win when the board is full of stones, it is a draw.
